            <h3>Sawmills, NC Insights: Population,
                 Influence, and Service Areas</h3>
            <p>The community of Sawmills began in the late 1800s. The name 'Sawmills' originates from the sawmills that were set up in the area due to the timber industry. The railroad system that ran through Caldwell County is one of the main reasons for the sawmills to locate in what would become the community of Sawmills. Sawmills was incorporated as a town in 1988. The nearby towns of Granite Falls and Hudson battling for potential business property in the area, is what led the Sawmills community to vote for incorporation.</p>
